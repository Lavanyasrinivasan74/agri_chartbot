Advanced Agriculture Bot (AgriBot)
Challenges Faced by Small-Scale Farmers
📜 Abstract
Technologies like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the Internet of Things (IoT), irrigation automation, and smartphones are revolutionizing small-scale farming. This project aims to provide solutions to the challenges faced by small-scale farmers through a web application that integrates AI, data processing, and recommendation systems to optimize farming practices.

🚜 Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)
Backend: MySQL
Database: MongoDB
API Framework: Python (Django)
AI Model: Natural Language Processing (NLP


💡 Modules
1. Data Processing
Collects and cleans raw data for AI model training.
Removes duplicate/unnecessary data to provide accurate inputs.
2. Data Visualization
Visualizes farming data with user-friendly graphics for ease of interpretation.
3. AI Model
Utilizes NLP algorithms to train the AI to provide recommendations and solutions for farming issues.
4. Web Application
A web-based platform where farmers can access personalized farming recommendations and solutions, integrating a chatbot for real-time problem-solving.
